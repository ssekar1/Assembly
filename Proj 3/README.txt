A program using NASM that will allow the user to enter five id numbers and names. After entering the data,
the program will prompt for an id number. If the id number is valid, the program will allow you to change the
name associated with the id. If the id number is not present, an error message should print. This process will
continue until the user enters 00 for the id to stop the looping. After the user enters 00, all the names and ids
should print out.

A program using NASM that will allow the user to enter an integer in base 10 from 0 to 255 and will change
the number into base n (where n is from 2 to 9). The user should be allowed to enter different bases until they put
in the value 0 (the sentinel value to stop the program). In addition to writing the base conversion on the screen,
the base conversions should also be recorded in a text file named by the command-line argument.

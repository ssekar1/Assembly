A program using nasm that will ask the user for one ASCII character at a time and will produce output based
on the rules below:

1. If it is a lower case alphabetic character, it will output the upper case version

2. If it is a upper case alphabetic character, it will output the lower case version

3. If it is a digit, it will print out 10 more * than the digit

4. If it is any other ASCII char, it will just echo it back out the number of iterations that it is on
(ASCII 10 should not be processed).
